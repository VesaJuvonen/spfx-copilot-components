## Host validation notes

- Verify selected tool and extracted properties in an authenticated Copilot tenant.
- Verify Expand lands in the tool's configured lens and preserves supported context.
- Verify a fresh prompt resets defaults while a passive host rerender preserves local interaction state.
- Local source validation proves catalog metadata alignment, not model routing behavior.
