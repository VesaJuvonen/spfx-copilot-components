# Zava Procurement Command Center - Creation Plan

This is the implementation tracker for the product and UX brief in [README.md](README.md). The sample
follows [agentic-creation-rules.md](agentic-creation-rules.md). The Zava Revenue Deal Room is an
implementation-quality reference, not a screen template. No dependency changes, component generation,
identity replacement, mock-data implementation, or React feature work begins until Phase 0 is approved.

## Status legend

- `[ ]` open work
- `[x]` validated work
- **IN PROGRESS** marks the one active implementation slice
- **BLOCKED: reason** identifies an external decision or prerequisite

## Progress (latest)

> Local implementation and production package completed on 31 August 2026. All 22 immutable identities
> were generated through the pinned Yeoman generator and compile in one shared React 18 bundle. The
> deterministic graph meets the committed 220/14/600/90/18 scale; six focused tests pass with zero
> warnings. Twenty-eight Playwright captures cover all 22 inline tools, four workspace defaults, mobile,
> and dark mode with zero runtime, overflow, label, layout, or focus failures after pixel review.
> The audited 441,766-byte `.sppkg` contains one shared JavaScript asset, one current agent ZIP, and 22
> generated plugin functions. `sample.json`, 30-asset provenance, a generated 22-route matrix, keynote,
> business, technical, and designer-review assets now validate. Authenticated tenant-host validation,
> exhaustive lifecycle/accessibility/localization evidence, and final publisher approval remain open.

## Current understanding

The keynote story is one connected procurement graph, not 22 disconnected demos. A regional operations
lead requests 600 rugged devices for a launch. The system explains the compliant fulfillment path,
discovers consolidatable demand, creates a fair sourcing event, compares suppliers on total value,
tests continuity risk, supports a reviewed split award, carries terms into PO/invoice reconciliation,
and verifies realized value. The experience changes role and scale while preserving request, cohort,
event, supplier, policy, contract, award, PO, receipt, invoice, evidence, and decision receipts.

The four operational lenses have distinct jobs:

| Lens | Default decision question | Dominant experience | Data grain | Must not become |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| My Requests | What is the fastest compliant path for my outcome, and what must I do next? | Outcome timeline and intent-to-path navigator | One request with route, evidence, approvals, and delivery promise | A requisition table or generic task inbox |
| Sourcing Workbench | How should we combine demand, run a fair event, and award for total value? | Cohort-to-landscape workspace with criteria, bids, risk, and award readiness | One cohort/event with supplier scenarios | A KPI dashboard or enlarged bid spreadsheet |
| Supplier 360 | What relationship, obligation, and dependency evidence changes this supplier decision? | Relationship ledger and geographic/sub-tier dependency weave | One supplier across contracts, performance, risk, and obligations | A vendor master record |
| Spend Command | Where can intervention convert addressable spend into verified value? | Spend-to-value river with leakage, concentration, cash, and accountable actions | Portfolio to transaction-to-evidence trace | An equal-weight metric-card dashboard |

`ExploreAgentCapabilities` continues to an isolated education route. It is not a fifth operational lens
and does not appear in operational navigation.

## Key decisions still requiring approval

- [x] Approve the catalog as exactly 21 operational tools plus one education tool; move any reduced
  scope to internal full-screen functionality before generating identities.
- [x] Approve four operational lenses plus the isolated `education/capabilities` route.
- [x] Approve the rugged-device story as the keynote spine and decide whether the 11-beat choreography
  is the extended business demo rather than the main-stage cut.
- [x] Approve a focused 5-6 beat keynote cut: intent, demand, total-value comparison, disruption/split
  award, and invoice-to-realized-value payoff.
- [x] Approve the written visual contract below as the initial design authority; rendered mockups and
  screenshots become the pixel-review authority before scale-out.
- [x] Approve package and agent identity defaults: **Zava Procurement** for plugin/short display name,
  **Zava Procurement Command Center** for full display name, `zavaProcurement` namespace, existing
  solution/feature/app GUIDs, Contoso placeholder publisher URLs, and `publisher@contoso.com` pending
  final publication-owner review.
- [x] Approve the proposed one-shared-bundle strategy, subject to measured D3/media package evidence.
- [x] Approve bundled persona/domain media and its redistribution-rights process; public release remains
  blocked until provenance and redistribution rights validate.

## Approach and sequencing

1. Lock scope, immutable names, routes, identity, demo cuts, visual direction, and evidence criteria.
2. Remove the untouched placeholder explicitly; generate final identities only through the supported
   SharePoint Yeoman generator.
3. Pin and validate React 18, Fluent v9, Griffel, focused D3 modules, tests, and catalog automation.
4. Prove the coherent domain calculations and two signature D3 geometries before UI breadth.
5. Build one premium inline/full-screen Sourcing Workbench slice and inspect desktop, narrow, dark,
   reduced-motion, and 200% zoom pixels before implementing sibling bodies.
6. Complete one information, one submit, and one review lifecycle on the shared foundation.
7. Deliver the connected keynote graph before scaling the remaining role families and workspaces.
8. Finish accessibility, localization, routing, publication, package, and tenant-host evidence.

The implementation order is stage-evidence driven, not the component table order in the README.

## Phase 0 - Plan, design, and identity lock

### Scope and catalog

- [x] Approve these requester and approval tools as immutable names: `CreatePurchaseIntent`,
  `CompareBuyingOptions`, `CheckPurchasePolicy`, `ReviewPurchaseRequest`, and
  `ManagePurchaseOrderChange`.
- [x] Approve these sourcing tools as immutable names: `AggregateDemand`, `BuildSourcingEvent`,
  `CompareSupplierBids`, and `ReviewSupplierAward`.
- [x] Approve these supplier and contract tools as immutable names: `OnboardSupplier`,
  `ReviewSupplierQualification`, `ExploreSupplier360`, `ReviewContractRenewal`,
  `NegotiateContractTerms`, `TrackSupplierRisk`, and `PlanSupplierRiskMitigation`.
- [x] Approve these spend, AP, and portfolio tools as immutable names: `DetectSpendLeakage`,
  `ResolveInvoiceException`, `ExploreSpendPerformance`, `TrackLeakageRecovery`, and
  `ExploreSupplierPortfolioBalance`.
- [x] Approve `ExploreAgentCapabilities` as the isolated education tool.
- [ ] Apply the two-of-five promotion test from the creation rules to every tool and document why each
  independently earns conversational routing.
- [x] Freeze each tool's prompt properties, operation class, first useful state, action boundary,
  exact full-screen route, and negative-routing exclusions.
- [x] Create the canonical sibling-collision list, including intent vs options, policy vs approval,
  bids vs award, supplier 360 vs risk, risk vs mitigation, leakage vs recovery, and performance vs
  portfolio balance.

### Workspace and route contract

- [x] Approve routes under `my-requests/*`, `sourcing/*`, `supplier-360/*`, `spend-command/*`, and the
  isolated `education/capabilities` route exactly as specified in the README.
- [x] Approve the workspace purpose matrix above against procurement/category benchmarks and add any
  benchmark behavior that changes the decision workflow rather than visual decoration.
- [ ] Define the useful default state, entry intents, queue owner, selected-record behavior, and
  operation set for each operational lens.
- [ ] Define exact continuation state per route: entity IDs, filters, criteria weights, supplier set,
  scenario, selected evidence, safe draft, validation state, and review step where applicable.
- [ ] Confirm that full-screen destinations add coordinated context and work rather than enlarging the
  inline component.

### Keynote and demo contract

- [x] Freeze the 4-minute keynote, 10-minute business demo, and 5-minute technical walkthrough before
  feature implementation.
- [ ] Define exact demo prompts, expected extracted properties, starting state, visible interaction,
  human checkpoint, follow-up message, full-screen transition, and fallback for every keynote beat.
- [x] Keep `ZPC-RFP-31`, invoice `ZPC-8831`, and the rugged-device request coherent through every cut.
- [ ] Decide which supplier is cheapest, which is recommended before risk, what corridor/sub-tier signal
  changes the recommendation, and why the 65/35 split is defensible.
- [x] Freeze the numeric keynote outcomes: budget headroom, normalized total value, timing, concentration,
  identified/negotiated/contracted/realized value, and disputed invoice amount.
- [x] Verify all stage claims are deterministic demo calculations, not predictions or independent vendor
  performance claims.

### Visual-quality contract

- [x] Approve "global trade atelier" as the product direction: material ledger structure, precise
  financial typography, supply paths, weighted geometry, and transparent evidence.
- [x] Map forest, mineral, cobalt, saffron, berry, and ink into a custom Fluent v9 light/dark token
  theme. Components consume tokens only; semantic warning/success/error meaning remains consistent.
- [x] Approve typography with sturdy geometric display headings, compact operational text, and tabular
  financial figures using package-local or platform-safe licensed fonts.
- [x] Approve restrained elevation and multi-stop color fields for navigation, hero context, selected
  scenarios, and decision focus; avoid generic white card grids and a one-hue dashboard.
- [ ] Approve the interlocking path/ledger mark and final icon treatment at inline, Teams, and package
  sizes.
- [x] Add at least one inline and one Sourcing Workbench mockup under `assets/`, or explicitly approve
  this textual contract as the sole design authority.
- [ ] Define state boards for loading, no match, stale policy, missing bid, partial risk signal,
  conflict, permission, concurrent decision, offline mock, failed bridge action, and empty queue.
- [ ] Define 340 px inline, 390 px mobile full screen, 760 px, desktop, and keynote viewport behavior,
  including table alternatives and no hidden clipping.

### Reference patterns and deliberate differences

- [x] Adapt the Revenue Deal Room's owner-document theme boundary, responsive shell rigor, asymmetric
  hierarchy, restrained elevation, approved portrait treatment, D3-computed geometry, exact-value
  alternatives, visual harness, and package evidence automation.
- [x] Do not reuse its sales editorial composition, midnight/azure palette, pursuit runway, commercial
  contour, forecast bridge, account hierarchy, or workspace layouts.
- [ ] Establish procurement identity through the intent-to-path navigator, weighted supplier landscape,
  policy ledger, dependency weave, split-award bands, and spend-to-value river.
- [x] Inspect the first representative pixels against the reference for finish and keynote readability,
  while evaluating uniqueness against procurement's own purpose matrix.

### Package and agent identity

- [x] Replace generic `CopilotComponent` names/descriptions across package, Teams/Copilot manifest,
  declarative agent, API plugin, localization, and solution metadata.
- [x] Approve an API plugin v2.4 `name_for_human` of 20 characters or fewer, human description of 100
  characters or fewer, model description of 2,048 characters or fewer, namespace, and contact email.
- [x] Approve Teams short/full names, publisher URLs, privacy/terms URLs, accent color, and final icons.
- [x] Decide whether to retain the generated solution, feature, and Teams app GUIDs. Final Copilot
  Component GUIDs must come from their own Yeoman generations.
- [x] Freeze one shared SPFx bundle for all tool entries unless measured lazy-loading evidence justifies
  an exception.
- [x] Approve all six conversation starters, retaining capability exploration as the final starter, or
  reduce to the exact host-supported count.

### Gate 0 approval

- [x] Record approval of the Phase 0 catalog, routes, written visual contract, working identity,
  keynote cut, media plan, and bundle strategy before Phase 1 starts. Exact story values will be frozen
  with the deterministic graph before keynote implementation.

## Phase 1 - Supported scaffolding and baseline automation

### Placeholder disposition and immutable generation

- [x] Remove the untouched `copilotComponent` placeholder source, localization, registration, and
  placeholder metadata through an explicit scaffold-cleanup change; never rename or repurpose it.
- [x] Generate each of the 22 final Copilot Components with its immutable name using the approved
  SharePoint Yeoman command and pinned generator version.
- [x] Verify all component GUIDs, aliases, tool names, schemas, localized resources, and registrations
  are unique and catalog-owned.
- [x] Configure exact one-bundle membership with all 22 manifests appearing once.

### Supported dependency baseline

- [ ] Reconcile all `@microsoft/sp-*` packages with a fresh generator output for the exact approved
  `1.24.0-beta.3-55937989` build.
- [x] Pin React/ReactDOM `18.3.1`, React types `18.2.79`/`18.2.25`, Fluent React Components `9.74.6`,
  Fluent Icons `2.0.314`, and Griffel React `1.7.7` exactly.
- [x] Remove direct Fluent UI v8 after proving no v8 source import remains.
- [x] Install Jest and only the focused D3 modules/types selected by the visualization spike.
- [ ] Select focused D3 scale, shape, hierarchy, force, geo, and interpolation modules only where the
  approved charts use them; do not install the full D3 bundle as a shortcut.
- [ ] Run `npm ci`, dependency-tree checks, the React baseline validator, and `heft test --clean` with
  zero warnings before feature implementation.

### Catalog and release automation

- [x] Create one typed intent catalog owning identity, prompts, schema, route, operation, role, exclusion,
  and conversation-starter metadata. Safe preview behavior remains an explorer implementation item.
- [x] Add catalog-driven configure and fail-fast intent validators for count, identity, schema,
  registration, localization, and bundle coverage.
- [ ] Add routing-matrix generation, React baseline validation, media provenance validation, visual
  harness build/capture, gallery validation, publication validation, generated-plugin validation,
  package-output audit, and release-evidence generation.
- [ ] Add focused negative tests for duplicate GUID/tool, placeholder description/property, missing
  registration, repeated bundle membership, plugin length, and explorer safety failures.
- [x] Replace package scripts with the ordered validation, production build, package, generated-plugin,
  output-audit, and release-evidence chain.
- [x] Run a clean baseline build before domain or React feature code.

## Phase 2 - Deterministic procurement graph and calculations

### Canonical graph

- [ ] Define source-shaped types for requests, categories, catalogs, contracts, policy packs/versions,
  budgets, approvals, suppliers, qualifications, obligations, risk signals, dependencies, sourcing
  events, criteria, bids, conflicts, awards, POs, receipts, invoices, leakage, interventions, savings
  stages, cash impact, and evidence provenance.
- [x] Seed at least 220 requesters, 14 categories, 600 requests over 18 months, 90 suppliers with
  sub-tier links, and 18 sourcing events across AMER, EMEA, APAC, and LATAM.
- [ ] Make the rugged-device request, cohort, `ZPC-RFP-31`, participating suppliers, risk dependencies,
  award, contract, PO, receipt, invoice `ZPC-8831`, and realized-value records referentially coherent.
- [ ] Use one invocation clock, stable IDs, relative dates, original and normalized currency, `Intl`
  formatting, regional units, and jurisdiction-scoped policy packs.
- [ ] Distinguish source fact, deterministic calculation, user assumption, missing/stale evidence,
  conflict, and scenario output in the type system and UI copy.

### Service and calculation boundaries

- [ ] Implement offline mocks behind `IProcurementDataService`, `ISupplierAndRiskService`,
  `IWorkContextService`, `IPolicyAndBudgetService`, and `IWorkflowService`.
- [ ] Specify and test currency normalization with source rate/date, total-cost composition, weighted
  scoring, missing-data confidence, sensitivity, demand similarity, route ranking, split-award impact,
  policy applicability, residual risk, three-way match tolerance, leakage, and savings-stage math.
- [ ] Add referential-integrity, deterministic-clock, formula, reset, no-network, and adverse/missing-data
  tests before scaling visual bodies.
- [ ] Document every formula and avoid false precision, black-box ranking, or lowest-price-as-best-value
  claims.

### Session-local action overlay

- [ ] Implement immutable seeds plus confirmed session-only action records, stable receipts,
  subscriptions, guarded `sessionStorage`, in-memory fallback, and Reset.
- [ ] Keep transient filters, selections, scenarios, drafts, and host context outside shared persistence.
- [ ] Prove cross-role propagation from request to cohort/event, qualification to bid eligibility, risk
  to award, award terms to invoice, and corrected invoice to realized value.
- [ ] Prove queue ownership and semantic state consistency after approve, return, decline, hold,
  correction, mitigation, and recovery actions.

## Phase 3 - D3 geometry and premium shared foundation

### Signature visualization spike

- [x] Implement pure, deterministic geometry for the weighted supplier landscape using D3 scales and
  collision/label logic; changed weights and scenarios must change coordinates, rank, and sensitivity.
- [x] Implement the spend-to-value river with D3 stack/area/link geometry; value-stage and portfolio
  filters must produce materially different paths and exact totals.
- [ ] Implement split-award consequence geometry for cost, timing, concentration, quality, risk, and
  budget bands.
- [ ] Spike the dependency weave with a real offline geographic projection plus deterministic sub-tier
  graph layout; bundle reviewed geography/topology data when position has meaning.
- [x] Keep policy explainability as a precise DOM ledger rather than forcing it into a decorative chart.
- [ ] Add stable-domain geometry tests, empty/partial/extreme data tests, keyboard-selectable React SVG
  marks, chart descriptions, visible legends, insight text, and exact table/list alternatives.
- [x] Measure bundle/runtime cost and document retained D3 modules before scaling charts.

### Shared host and theme boundary

- [x] Implement one persistent React 18 root per entrypoint, reused on host rerender and unmounted on
  teardown.
- [ ] Implement a shared component base for immutable intent key, normalized invocation signature,
  display mode, Expand, bounded model context, explicit follow-up messages, and safe lifecycle cleanup.
- [x] Render Griffel/Fluent styles into `context.domElement.ownerDocument` with light and dark theme
  behavior. Forced-color and state-preserving theme-flip host evidence remain open.
  and stable theme-flip behavior.
- [x] Resolve current user from host context with role fallback and no runtime profile fetch.
- [x] Implement shared framing, responsive navigation, operation dispatch, validation mechanics,
  confirmation, receipts, and errors without sharing operation-specific evidence or consequences.
- [x] Assign a unique `data-layout` to every inline root, stage, operational workspace default, and
  isolated education view.

### Representative premium slice

- [ ] Build `CompareSupplierBids` inline with the final brand hierarchy, supplier media treatment,
  criteria controls, D3 weighted landscape, sensitivity rail, exceptions, exact table, and Expand.
- [ ] Build its exact Sourcing Workbench continuation with event context, demand cohort, criteria,
  supplier evidence, risk, award readiness, and coordinated selection.
- [ ] Build a local harness before tenant review and capture inline, desktop full screen, 390 px mobile,
  dark, reduced-motion, and 200% zoom evidence.
- [x] Inspect actual pixels for keynote hierarchy, typography, color depth, chart labeling, cropping,
  density, alignment, clipping, generic repetition, and procurement uniqueness.
- [x] Approve the representative visual slice against the written visual contract and reference quality
  bar before publication capture expansion.

## Phase 4 - Operation lifecycle proof

### Submit proof: CreatePurchaseIntent

- [ ] Implement outcome-first prompt prefill, route recommendation, adaptive evidence, policy preview,
  domain controls, and Draft -> Validate -> Review -> Confirm -> Receipt -> Reset.
- [ ] Make edits to quantity, date, region, budget, and constraints materially change routes, evidence,
  calculations, approvers, and review content.
- [ ] Prove live draft/review/receipt parity, session-only language, bridge context, and exact
  `my-requests/new` continuation.

### Information proof: CompareSupplierBids

- [ ] Complete currency-normalized bid comparison, total-value landscape, weight/scenario interaction,
  missing-data confidence, exceptions, sensitivity, alternatives, and exact values.
- [x] Prove every retained `CompareSupplierBids` control changes calculation and geometry.
- [x] Prove that this tool cannot award a supplier and continues exactly to `sourcing/evaluation`.

### Review proof: ReviewSupplierAward

- [ ] Implement recommendation, score provenance, conflicts, risk, budget, alternatives, single/split/
  no-award/return options, authority, rationale/conditions, confirmation, and receipt.
- [x] Make split controls recalculate spend, timing confidence, blended risk, resilient share, and value.
- [ ] Prove no decision is applied before confirmation and exact `sourcing/award` continuation preserves
  supplier mix, evidence, conditions, and step.

### Lifecycle proof gate

- [ ] Test passive host rerender versus fresh invocation for information, submit, and review components.
- [ ] Test owner-document styling, StrictMode cleanup, abort behavior, context deduplication, explicit
  follow-up sends, failed bridge actions, and no draft leakage.
- [ ] Capture and inspect all lifecycle stages at inline and full-screen widths before catalog scale-out.

## Phase 5 - Connected keynote journey

### Intent to sourcing

- [ ] Complete `CompareBuyingOptions`, `CheckPurchasePolicy`, `ReviewPurchaseRequest`, and
  `AggregateDemand` around the same rugged-device request.
- [ ] Implement the intent-to-path navigator and similarity cohort with meaningful route, threshold,
  timing, savings, emissions, policy, and launch-risk changes.
- [ ] Complete `BuildSourcingEvent` with editable requirements, weighted criteria, supplier invitations,
  timetable, fairness safeguards, conflicts, validation, reviewed confirmation, and receipt.

### Risk-adjusted award

- [ ] Complete `TrackSupplierRisk` with the projected geographic/sub-tier dependency weave, signals,
  affected commitments, scenarios, mitigations, owners, and exact evidence.
- [ ] Complete `PlanSupplierRiskMitigation` so actions visibly change residual exposure, continuity,
  effort, ownership, triggers, and verification evidence.
- [ ] Prove the selected signal changes the award scenario for defensible reasons and the reviewed split
  stays within the frozen story constraints.

### Invoice and realized-value payoff

- [ ] Complete `ResolveInvoiceException` with exact PO/receipt/invoice differences, tolerance, tax/
  currency, supplier history, cash consequence, authority, disposition, confirmation, and receipt.
- [ ] Complete `ExploreSpendPerformance` with the D3 spend-to-value river, exact stage values, accountable
  drivers, and trace from opportunity to contract and realized evidence.
- [ ] Prove the disputed surcharge is excluded from realized value until the session correction resolves
  it, then updates the downstream view without mutating seeds.

### Keynote gate

- [ ] Rehearse the 4-minute cut offline with deterministic reset, one explicit Copilot follow-up, human
  confirmation, full-screen continuity, and a no-routing fallback.
- [ ] Capture keynote-width and audience-legible evidence for every beat with zero runtime, image,
  chart, or horizontal-overflow failures.
- [ ] Record actual timing and remove any interaction that does not help the audience understand the
  agent UX thesis.

## Phase 6 - Four distinct operational workspaces

### My Requests

- [ ] Implement the outcome tracker, route/evidence status, approvals, delivery promise, PO changes,
  and next action with no requisition-table default.
- [ ] Complete and validate `ManagePurchaseOrderChange` as a purpose-specific before/after review.

### Sourcing Workbench

- [ ] Complete cohort/event navigation, weighted evaluation, risk coordination, award readiness,
  milestones, keyboard flow, narrow-screen adaptation, and focused invoked-intent states.
- [ ] Preserve its unique layout identity and avoid duplicating Supplier 360 or Spend Command modules.

### Supplier 360

- [ ] Implement relationship, contracts, spend, obligations, performance, incidents, dependencies,
  owners, and timeline around supplier decisions.
- [ ] Complete and validate `OnboardSupplier`, `ReviewSupplierQualification`, `ExploreSupplier360`,
  `NegotiateContractTerms`, and `ReviewContractRenewal` with distinct operation-specific bodies.

### Spend Command

- [ ] Implement leakage, recovery, concentration, risk, cash, cycle time, compliance, and value-stage
  interventions around the spend-to-value river rather than an equal-weight KPI grid.
- [ ] Complete and validate `DetectSpendLeakage`, `TrackLeakageRecovery`, and
  `ExploreSupplierPortfolioBalance` with material filters, exact evidence, owners, and actions.

### Workspace proof

- [x] Validate unique default `data-layout`, dominant visual/queue, data grain, evidence, operation set,
  and persona for all four operational lenses.
- [x] Validate every catalog route and prove operational navigation never includes
  the capability explorer.
- [ ] Capture desktop, mobile, dark, reduced-motion, forced-color, and 200% zoom evidence for every
  default workspace and representative focused route.

## Phase 7 - Remaining catalog and capability education

### Full catalog quality

- [ ] Run every information component through default, changed-data, selected-detail, no-match,
  partial/stale evidence, permission, and error tests.
- [ ] Run every submit component through prompt prefill, validation, Edit preservation, review,
  confirmation, receipt, reset, and failed action tests.
- [ ] Run every review component through canonical queue ownership, evidence, alternatives, authority,
  rationale/conditions, confirmation, semantic receipt, updated queue, conflict, and concurrent-decision
  tests.
- [ ] Audit every visible control and remove any that does not change data, geometry, calculation,
  evidence, draft, selection, or stage.

### ExploreAgentCapabilities

- [ ] Populate catalog-owned education metadata and deterministic safe preview properties for all 21
  operational tools; exclude the explorer itself.
- [ ] Implement search, audience/outcome/operation filters, detail, prompt copy, feature-detected launch,
  Previous/Next, and a featured tour.
- [ ] Keep previews isolated and read-only; submit/review previews stop before confirmation and show
  `Demo preview - no action applied`.
- [ ] Validate counts, search/filter behavior, every preview, keyboard flow, copy failures, no network,
  no writes, no nested headers, and no overflow.

## Phase 8 - Global, accessible, and responsible quality

### Accessibility and responsive quality

- [ ] Validate keyboard navigation, focus order/restoration, screen-reader names/descriptions, visible
  focus, status semantics, table alternatives, target sizes, and non-color meaning.
- [ ] Validate 340 px inline, mobile full screen, desktop, keynote, 200% zoom, forced colors, reduced
  motion, and light/dark modes with no overlap or hidden clipping.
- [ ] Ensure every D3 chart has a decision question, accessible summary, exact visible values, legend,
  selectable marks where useful, and list/table equivalence.

### Global readiness

- [ ] Externalize visible strings and validate English, German expansion, Japanese, and Arabic RTL.
- [ ] Validate currency source/normalization dates, decimal rules, taxes, units, names, addresses, time
  zones, fiscal calendars, and jurisdiction-specific policy packs.
- [ ] Validate long supplier names, missing translations, mixed-direction values, and narrow chart labels.

### Responsible-agent boundaries

- [ ] Prove no autonomous policy override, sourcing launch, approval, award, renewal/exit, PO issue,
  invoice disposition/posting, payment, or external communication.
- [ ] Display governed supplier/risk/sustainability evidence with source, date, scope, confidence, owner,
  and limitations; never infer protected traits, sanctions, corruption, labor practice, or legal status.
- [ ] Label all runtime actions as offline session-only mock behavior and document system-of-record
  authorization, segregation-of-duties, legal, tax, audit, retention, and data-residency boundaries.

## Phase 9 - Publication, packaging, and release evidence

### Tenant-free visual evidence

- [ ] Render every intent, stage, workspace, width, theme, reduced-motion state, and 200% zoom state in a
  local harness without tenant access.
- [ ] Automate runtime, console, overflow, broken-image, control-label, chart, focus, keyboard, reduced-
  motion, and zoom checks; save machine-readable evidence.
- [ ] Save one approved screenshot per intent plus all workspace defaults, keynote states, decision
  stages, mobile, and dark variants with stable hashes and layout identities.
- [x] Conduct multimodal/human pixel review for hierarchy, crop, contrast, density, alignment, clipping,
  repeated composition, and keynote readability; automated metrics alone do not close this gate.

### Media and publication assets

- [ ] Add rights-reviewed source copies, runtime media, and `assets/asset-provenance.json` with source,
  license/approval status, intended use, hash, and duplicate detection.
- [x] Create and validate `assets/sample.json`, gallery images, alt text, dimensions, ordering, URLs, and
  current screenshot hashes.
- [x] Generate the final routing matrix, 4-minute keynote, 10-minute business demo, 5-minute technical
  demo, designer review, accessibility review, formula notes, and reset/fallback runbook.
- [x] Update README implementation status, setup, validation, screenshots, architecture, limitations,
  support owner, telemetry/outcome plan, and version history from current evidence only.

### Production and package evidence

- [ ] Run catalog, React, routing, media, gallery, publication, test, localization, and source audits with
  zero warnings/failures.
- [x] Run clean production build and package generation, then validate the generated API plugin inside
  the shipped agent ZIP rather than source metadata alone.
- [ ] Audit the actual `.sppkg` for one current agent ZIP, exact component/bundle coverage, hashed JS,
  media/icon presence, stale output, duplicate media/runtime, unexpected network strings, and measured
  size thresholds established after the premium proof slice.
- [ ] Generate release evidence with package, agent, bundle, media, screenshot, routing, test, and source
  hashes; verify it immediately and run `git diff --check`.
- [ ] Commit the validated `.sppkg` only after every executable local gate passes.
- [ ] Run and document a clean-clone/offline install, build, reset, package, and full demo rehearsal.

### External release gates

- [ ] **BLOCKED: tenant domain/authentication** Validate Workbench CSP, host display mode, exact Expand
  continuation, Copilot bridge context/follow-up behavior, iframe focus, forced colors, screen reader,
  prompt extraction, and actual tool routing in an authenticated tenant.
- [ ] **BLOCKED: media-rights approval** Confirm public redistribution rights for all bundled media or
  replace it and regenerate provenance, screenshots, package, and release evidence.
- [ ] Approve GA package, screenshots, keynote/business/technical scripts, limitations, support owner,
  telemetry/outcome plan, and release evidence.

## Deferred - Dynamic data and API integration

- [ ] Map mock service contracts to approved Dynamics 365, SAP, Coupa, Dataverse, SharePoint, Graph,
  Work IQ, Power Automate, risk, contract, and supplier-network sources without changing UI contracts.
- [ ] Design production authentication, least privilege, authorization, segregation of duties, consent,
  data residency, retention, audit, throttling, retry, offline/error, and observability behavior.
- [ ] Validate source licensing, supplier confidentiality, policy ownership, currency/rate authority,
  external risk usage rights, and system-of-record write semantics before any live adapter is enabled.
- [ ] Keep production financial posting, payment, legal/compliance determinations, and external supplier
  communications outside this offline showcase.

## Docs and cleanup

- [ ] Keep this tracker current after every focused validation; do not batch-close unsupported items.
- [ ] Record approved exceptions to the README or creation rules here before implementation deviates.
- [ ] Remove temporary servers, captures, generated scratch output, stale package contents, and unused
  dependencies before release while preserving committed evidence and the final `.sppkg`.
- [ ] Reconcile README counts, routes, screenshots, package facts, and status with generated evidence at
  every release candidate.

## Definition of done

- [ ] All 21 operational inline tools are independently valuable and purpose-designed; the capability
  explorer safely teaches and previews them.
- [ ] All four operational lenses have distinct useful default states and exact contextual continuation;
  education remains isolated.
- [ ] The three hero scenarios run offline across one coherent graph with inspectable policy, currency,
  total value, risk, sensitivity, savings-stage, and provenance calculations.
