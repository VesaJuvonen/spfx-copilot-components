# Zava Employee Agent UX Design

## Purpose

This document is the canonical experience contract for the Zava Employee Agent. It translates the
existing composite mockups into implementable behavior for ten SPFx Copilot Component families.

The interaction model builds on two proven samples:

- `my-day`: personalized greeting, summary banner, deterministic recommendation engine, and a
  right-side panel that mimics a streamed AI response without making an API call.
- `time-off-absence`: optional Zod tool properties extracted from the prompt, prefilled controls,
  user review, derived values, and validation before submission.

The existing images under `assets/` remain visual references. Where an image and this document
conflict, this document controls behavior, naming, and component ownership.

## Experience Principles

1. **Personal before procedural.** Every full-screen dashboard starts with the signed-in user's
   identity, a time-aware greeting, and a concise statement of what matters in that area.
2. **Prompt values become visible controls.** Values extracted from the prompt prefill the inline
   experience. They never bypass review, validation, privacy checks, or confirmation.
3. **Summarize, explain, then act.** Surfaces show the result, why it matters, and the next action.
4. **AI behavior is honest and deterministic.** The showcase mimics generation and streaming from
   mocked data. It does not call an AI service and says so in the panel footnote.
5. **One journey, twenty high-value entry points.** Every current-target inline surface is
  independently callable through its own tool metadata. All 20 components reuse one ten-tab
  full-screen shell; 30 lower-priority intents remain documented for optimal future expansion.
6. **Keynote reliability wins.** Relative mock dates, stable ranking, accessible reduced-motion
   behavior, and no runtime network dependency keep every demo repeatable.

## Recommended Architecture

### Component Ownership

Generate the 20 selected SPFx Copilot Components in the value-ranked portfolio. Keep all five
completed Home components and add the 15 selected components across Families 02-10. Each component owns:

- Its manifest, GUID, tool description, and Zod properties schema.
- One focused inline intent surface.
- Only the optional parameters that visibly prefill or filter that intent.
- A fixed owning family, initial full-screen route, and normalized prompt-derived state.

Components in one family reuse shared family services, view models, and theme. The full catalog is
defined in [Zava-Employee-Agent-Component-Plan.md](Zava-Employee-Agent-Component-Plan.md).

All components import a shared `ZavaDashboardShell` for full-screen mode. The shell owns:

- The persistent ten-family navigation rail.
- The current family and detail route while full screen is open.
- The shared personalized header, settings, responsive layout, and right-side panel.
- Cross-family navigation from an action-plan recommendation.

This preserves fine-grained MCP/tool routing without implementing unrelated full-screen shells.
The shell opens on the family and route owned by the invoked component and can then switch family
internally.

### Display Modes

- **Inline:** Render only the invoked component's fixed intent surface. Show Expand only when the
  host advertises `fullscreen` in `availableDisplayModes`.
- **Full screen:** Render `ZavaDashboardShell` with `initialFamily`, `initialRoute`, and normalized
  prompt parameters. Navigation after opening is internal to the shell.
- **Right panel:** Render as a sibling column on wide screens. On narrow screens, render as a
  full-width overlay with Back and Close controls. Only one right panel is open at a time.

### Intent-to-fullscreen contract

Each component supplies immutable definition metadata alongside normalized prompt properties:

```ts
interface IZavaIntentComponentDefinition<TProperties> {
  family: ZavaFamilyId;
  route: string;
  normalize: (properties: TProperties) => Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

On Expand, the host changes display mode for the same invoked component. Its root renders
`ZavaDashboardShell` with `initialFamily`, `initialRoute`, `initialParams`, and the current properties
version. The shell must apply these values on a fresh invocation, focus the destination heading, and
then own internal navigation. No generic `view` parameter selects sibling inline intents.

### Navigation Contract

The canonical rail order is:

1. Home
2. Time
3. Money
4. Benefits
5. Rewards
6. Policy
7. Support
8. Learning
9. Team
10. People

User-facing rail labels stay short. Accessible labels and tooltips use the full family names.

An action destination uses a typed route rather than a URL:

```ts
type ZavaFamilyId =
  | 'home'
  | 'time'
  | 'money'
  | 'benefits'
  | 'rewards'
  | 'policy'
  | 'support'
  | 'learning'
  | 'team'
  | 'people';

interface IZavaDestination {
  family: ZavaFamilyId;
  route: string;
  params?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | string[]>;
}
```

The shell handles `onNavigate(destination)` by selecting the family, applying validated parameters,
and focusing the destination heading. Browser URLs and external applications are not required for
the mocked showcase.

During incremental implementation, all ten shell destinations remain selectable. Home renders its
completed dashboard; a family that has not yet reached its implementation phase renders only its
family-colored personalized title region above an empty canvas. It must not imitate family data,
tools, cards, or workflows before that family's Copilot Component has been generated and designed.

### Family Theme Contract

Every family owns one unique theme variant in the shared `familyThemes` registry. Full-screen title
regions use a same-hue dark-to-saturated-to-light gradient; navigation, badges, and future inline
surfaces reuse the same accent, foreground, and subtle background tokens.

| Family | Theme palette |
| --- | --- |
| Home | Zava brand blue |
| Time | Teal |
| Money | Green |
| Benefits | Blue |
| Rewards | Gold |
| Policy | Purple |
| Support | Cranberry |
| Learning | Cornflower |
| Team | Pumpkin |
| People | Berry |

Do not substitute a generic brand gradient inside a family component. New inline components must
resolve their visual identity from the shared family metadata and theme registry so inline and
full-screen modes remain recognizably connected.

## Shared Full-Screen Composition

### Personalized Top Region

Every family uses the same hierarchy:

1. Signed-in user's avatar, first name, and optional job title or manager scope.
2. Time-aware greeting based on the client clock:
   - Before 05:00: `Good morning` with an early-start acknowledgement.
   - 05:00-11:59: `Good morning`.
   - 12:00-16:59: `Good afternoon`.
   - 17:00-21:59: `Good evening`.
   - From 22:00: `Good evening` with a late-hours acknowledgement.
3. Family name and one sentence describing the current area state.
4. Three or four family metrics derived from mock data.
5. Settings icon. The AI summary is a separate banner below the hero so both controls remain clear.

Use the real host user when available and a stable Zava persona fallback otherwise. Resolve the clock
once per mount so text and relative dates do not change midway through a keynote interaction.

### Area Priority Banner

Below the hero, every family has a compact priority banner inspired by `PlanYourDayBanner`:

- Sparkle icon and family accent.
- A short title, such as `Your leave priorities`.
- One deterministic summary sentence, such as
  `You have one request to confirm and three carryover days expiring soon.`
- One action button that opens the family priority panel.

The Home version is the cross-family signature feature:

- **Banner title:** `Your HR priorities`
- **Button:** `Build my HR action plan`
- **Panel title:** `My HR action plan`
- **Purpose:** Summarize the most important items across all ten families.

Avoid `My tasks to be completed`; it reads like a generic task list and understates the
cross-domain reasoning. `My HR action plan` is concise, personal, and action-oriented.

### Mocked AI Panel

The panel copies the reliable interaction cadence from `my-day` while adding direct navigation:

1. **Thinking, 800 ms:** Spinner, shimmer, and `Reviewing your HR signals...`.
2. **Streaming, 220 ms per item:** Reveal up to five ranked recommendations.
3. **Done:** Announce completion to assistive technology and focus the first recommendation heading.
4. **Reduced motion:** Skip delays and render the complete plan immediately.

Each recommendation contains:

- Rank and family icon.
- Action title.
- One-sentence reason grounded in mock data.
- Due date or suggested timing when relevant.
- Source label, such as Learning, Benefits, or Time & Leave.
- Primary command, such as `Open in Learning`.
- Optional secondary command, such as `Remind me Friday`.
- Typed destination for direct full-screen navigation.

The fixed panel footnote is:

> AI-style suggestions in this demo are generated locally from sample data. No AI service is called,
> and changes are not saved.

### Deterministic Recommendation Model

The shared mock engine returns a stable contract:

```ts
type HrPriority = 'critical' | 'high' | 'normal' | 'optional';

interface IHrActionItem {
  id: string;
  family: ZavaFamilyId;
  title: string;
  reason: string;
  priority: HrPriority;
  dueOffsetDays?: number;
  suggestedTime?: string;
  destination: IZavaDestination;
}

interface IHrActionPlan {
  headline: string;
  generatedAt: Date;
  items: IHrActionItem[];
}
```

Ranking is deterministic:

1. Blocking compliance, coverage, privacy, or payroll issues.
2. Items due today or overdue.
3. Approvals and requests due in the next seven days.
4. Enrollment, carryover, learning, and manager signals due later.
5. Optional growth and profile-quality recommendations.

Use relative offsets in seed data and resolve them against the mount clock. Never use random ranking.

## Family Dashboard Designs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every family dashboard implements all five original experiences below. The current-target list
> identifies which experiences also have independent inline Copilot Components and MCP tools. Items
> labeled optimal-future are already available as internal full-screen routes; only their promotion
> to separate prompt-addressable inline components is deferred.

## Inline Parameter Contract

### Common Properties

Each component has one fixed intent and its own minimal optional schema. There is no public `view`
discriminator. Shared field names remain consistent only when they visibly control that component:

```ts
const commonProperties = {
  locale: z.string().optional().describe('Optional BCP 47 locale requested by the user.'),
  privacyLevel: z
    .enum(['standard', 'private', 'sensitive'])
    .optional()
    .describe('Optional privacy level to apply before rendering sensitive information.')
};
```

Use specific enums instead of open strings wherever the choices are known. Every field description
must explain format, examples, and the control it prefills.

### Prompt-to-Control Lifecycle

1. Copilot selects the family tool and extracts only explicitly supplied values.
2. The component normalizes dates, enum aliases, identifiers, and locale-sensitive values.
3. React state initializes from normalized properties.
4. A new tool invocation resets editable state from the new properties. Passive host changes such as
   theme or dimensions do not erase user edits.
5. Derived values recalculate, such as working days, plan totals, or pay comparisons.
6. Validation and mocked conflict checks run.
7. The user reviews and confirms any transaction.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `time-off-absence` reference initializes state from tool properties correctly on first mount,
> but its current `propertiesVersion` does not reach the form state. Zava must explicitly distinguish
> a fresh tool invocation from a passive rerender so a second prompt updates the prefilled controls.

### Date Rules

- Tool dates use ISO `yyyy-mm-dd` strings.
- Date ranges are inclusive unless a field explicitly says otherwise.
- Relative language such as `next Friday` is resolved by Copilot before invocation.
- The component tolerates invalid or partial values by showing validation; it never throws during
  render.
- End dates cannot precede start dates.
- Transactions calculate business days and show holidays or conflicts before confirmation.

### Parameter Showcase Scenarios

Use these prompts in demos and automated interaction tests:

1. `I'd like vacation from August 4th to August 12th, 2027 for a family trip.`
   Opens PTO & Leave request with leave type, dates, and reason prefilled.
2. `Compare family medical plans for two children, prioritizing dental and low deductible.`
   Opens Benefits comparison with family tier, dependent count, and priorities applied.
3. `Why did my July 2026 pay change compared with June? Include deductions.`
   Opens Payroll change explanation with both periods and deduction detail.
4. `What is the parental leave policy in Finland and Sweden as of August 1st? Show sources.`
   Opens Policy comparison with jurisdictions, effective date, and citations visible.
5. `Open a private payroll case about an unexplained deduction.`
   Opens HR Case Desk intake with category, privacy level, and subject prefilled for review.
6. `Show required learning due in the next 14 days.`
   Opens Learning required view with the deadline filter applied.
7. `Show approvals and absence risks for my team this month.`
   Opens Manager Team Hub with approvals, risks, and period applied.
8. `Find an accessibility expert for my customer keynote.`
   Opens People expert search with the expertise and context applied.

## Mock Data Requirements

The Home action plan needs enough connected data to summarize all areas. Seed one coherent Zava
persona story rather than ten unrelated datasets:

- One required privacy course due in three days.
- One vacation request draft with a date conflict and healthy team coverage.
- One benefits enrollment deadline in 23 days.
- One recently changed payroll deduction with a plausible explanation.
- One open HR case waiting for the user's response.
- One equity vest date later this month.
- Two manager approvals, one high priority.
- One upcoming one-to-one and three relevant experts.

Every seed uses relative offsets. IDs referenced by action-plan destinations must exist in the owning
family dataset so direct navigation always lands on a real mocked detail.

## Visual and Interaction Quality Bar

- Use Fluent UI v9 components and semantic tokens. Family accents may guide emphasis but must not
  replace semantic success, warning, and danger colors.
- Use icons for icon actions and tooltips for unfamiliar controls.
- Keep compact dashboard headings proportional to the panels; reserve large type for the hero.
- No nested cards. The shell, hero, and page bands are unframed; cards represent individual data or
  action units.
- Keep animations meaningful: initial stagger, right-panel entrance, and mocked stream only.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and maintain keyboard focus when panels open, close, or navigate.
- On mobile, replace the persistent rail with an accessible family menu and show right panels as
  full-width layers.
- Every mocked transaction has review, validation, success, empty, and error/fallback states.
- Show `Mock data - offline` quietly in the shell footer and the AI disclosure in the action panel.

## Design Asset Work Required

The current image set is useful for composition but is not presentation-ready. Before keynote use:

1. Re-export assets with Zava Employee Agent branding and filenames matching visible content.
2. Create a dedicated My HR Dashboard full-screen design with the priority banner and action panel.
3. Create a dedicated Total Rewards full-screen design distinct from Payroll.
4. Add a time-aware personalized hero and area priority banner to every full-screen design.
5. Show the action panel in open and completed states, including a direct family navigation command.
6. Add prompt-prefilled inline states for PTO, Benefits, Payroll, Policy, HR Case, Team, and People.
7. Show desktop, narrow desktop with panel open, and mobile behavior for the shared shell.
8. Replace the proposed persistent `Ask the agent` input with the action banner and host chat. A
   second prompt box inside the component duplicates Copilot and competes with the settings control.

## Acceptance Checklist

- The current portfolio has 20 fixed-intent inline components across all ten families.
- All ten full-screen dashboards identify the user and use a time-aware greeting.
- All ten dashboards have an area-specific state sentence, metrics, priority banner, and panel CTA.
- Home ranks cross-family mocked signals and routes every item to an existing destination.
- Mocked generation has thinking, streaming, done, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Prompt parameters visibly prefill controls and remain editable.
- A second prompt refreshes prefilled state without a page reload.
- No prompt-derived transaction submits without user confirmation.
- Payroll and Total Rewards remain visibly and conceptually distinct.
- The shell works with pointer, keyboard, screen reader, light theme, dark theme, and narrow layouts.
