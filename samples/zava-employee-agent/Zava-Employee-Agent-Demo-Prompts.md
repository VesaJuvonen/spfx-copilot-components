# Zava Employee Agent demo prompts

Use this catalog to test tool selection and parameter extraction in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Start a new conversation when testing routing collisions. Each prompt should select exactly one inline Copilot Component.

> Expected properties below are the normalized values used by the component. When a prompt omits a field, the component may apply the documented offline-demo default. Prompt values prefill or filter UX; they never submit or decide automatically.

For a presentation-ready inline-to-full-screen narrative, use the timed
[Zava Employee Agent 3-minute demo story](Zava-Employee-Agent-3-Minute-Demo.md).
