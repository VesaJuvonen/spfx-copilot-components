# Zava Employee Agent implementation tracker

This is the single source of truth for implementation progress against [README.md](README.md),
[Zava-Employee-Agent-Intro-Brief.md](Zava-Employee-Agent-Intro-Brief.md), and the canonical
[Zava-Employee-Agent-UX-Design.md](Zava-Employee-Agent-UX-Design.md). Follow
[agentic-creation-rules.md](agentic-creation-rules.md) for every phase.

> Status legend: ▢ not started · 🔶 in progress · ✅ done

> **Progress (latest):** Phases 0-15 and all locally automatable release gates are complete. All 20 value-ranked Copilot Components are
> independently prompt-addressable, package in one Zava Employee Agent, and reuse the implemented
> ten-family full-screen shell. Every family retains all five originally planned experiences as
> complete internal full-screen routes, for 50 internal views total; only 20 are promoted to inline
> Copilot Components/MCP tools. The clean gate passes 39 suites and 170 tests, validates 20 generated
> API-plugin functions and mirrored MCP tools, and emits one shared 910,310-byte JavaScript bundle in a
> ~0.493 MiB `.sppkg`, with no stale output or duplicated image payloads. Remaining Phase 16 blockers
> require authenticated Copilot routing evidence, the final manual accessibility/viewport matrix, and
> final implementation screenshots/gallery metadata before GitHub publication.

## Approach and sequencing

- Complete one family at a time in numeric order, starting with My HR Dashboard.
- Do not begin the next family until the current family passes `heft test --clean` with zero warnings
  and its UX has been reviewed.
- The human creates every new Copilot Component with the supported Yeoman command. The agent never
  manually creates, copies, renames, or restructures a component scaffold.
- Build UX-first against coherent, Graph-shaped mock data. Defer live Microsoft Graph, SharePoint,
  PnPjs, provisioning, and real AI calls.
- After each new family, update Home summaries, action-plan ranking, and direct destinations so Home
  grows with the implemented solution.
- Keep this file current: mark an item 🔶 before starting it and ✅ immediately after validation.

## Inline experience delivery map

Each named inline experience is an independently prompt-addressable Copilot Component and MCP app
tool. Components in the same family share services, visual theme, and full-screen destination, but
each receives its own Yeoman scaffold, manifest GUID, bundle, tool description, and minimal optional
parameter schema. Home's current multi-view implementation is transitional until Phase 6 extraction.

| Family | Component phase | Intent components | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| My HR Dashboard | Phase 6 | `GetMyHrDashboard`; `GetProfileHealth`; `GetNextBestActions`; `GetWorklifeSnapshot`; `GetEmployeeMilestones` | ✅ 5/5 complete |
| Policy Q&A | Phase 7 | `PolicyAnswer`; `PolicyComparison` | ✅ 2/2 complete |
| PTO & Leave | Phase 8 | `LeaveBalance`; `RequestTimeOff` | ✅ 2/2 complete |
| Payroll Explainer | Phase 9 | `LatestPay`; `ExplainPayChange` | ✅ 2/2 complete |
| Benefits & Life Events | Phase 10 | `CompareBenefitPlans`; `StartLifeEvent` | ✅ 2/2 complete |
| HR Case Desk | Phase 11 | `CreateHrCase` | ✅ 1/1 complete |
| Learning & Compliance | Phase 12 | `RequiredLearning` | ✅ 1/1 complete |
| Total Rewards | Phase 13 | `TotalRewardsSummary` | ✅ 1/1 complete |
| Manager Team Hub | Phase 14 | `ApprovalInbox`; `TeamAbsenceCalendar` | ✅ 2/2 complete |
| Org & People Graph | Phase 15 | `FindExpert`; `ExploreOrganization` | ✅ 2/2 complete |

## Phase 0 - Scaffold, brief, and initial configuration

### Human-provided foundation

- ✅ Scaffold the SPFx 1.24 solution with the SharePoint Yeoman generator.
- ✅ Scaffold Family 01 as the `GetMyHrDashboard` Copilot Component.
- ✅ Add the product objectives in `README.md` and `Zava-Employee-Agent-Intro-Brief.md`.

### Initial configuration - agent

- ✅ Install `react@17.0.1` and `react-dom@17.0.1` as runtime dependencies.
- ✅ Install `@types/react@17.0.45` and `@types/react-dom@17.0.17` as development dependencies.
- ✅ Install `@fluentui/react-components@9.54.0` and `@fluentui/react-icons@2.0.270`.
- ✅ Confirm TypeScript uses classic React JSX and remains compatible with React 17.
- ✅ Run `heft test --clean` and resolve all warnings or errors introduced by initial configuration.

### Design-source cleanup

- ✅ Re-export or replace the Family 01 inline and full-screen PNGs with Zava Employee Agent branding.
- ✅ Add a dedicated Home full-screen design containing the personalized hero, Home metrics, Your HR
  priorities banner, and My HR action plan panel.
- ✅ Add wide desktop, right-panel-open, narrow desktop, and mobile Home references.

- ✅ Define shared user, metric, priority, grounding, action, and settings view models.
- ✅ Define Graph-shaped raw mock types separately from lean UI view models.
- ✅ Define relative-offset seed types; do not hard-code demo dates or clock-specific copy.

### Coherent Zava story

- ✅ Seed one connected employee story spanning learning, leave, benefits, payroll, support, rewards,
  approvals, and people context.
- ✅ Include one privacy course due soon, one leave draft with a conflict, one enrollment deadline, one
  explainable payroll change, one case awaiting response, one equity vest, two approvals, one
  upcoming one-to-one, and three experts.

## Optimal future - Additional inline components

These 30 intents remain useful candidates after the current 20-tool showcase. They are not part of
Phases 7-15 and must not be scaffolded opportunistically. Their data and interactions may still appear
inside the owning full-screen tab when they support a selected component's end-to-end journey.

Promote a future intent only when user evidence shows frequent direct prompting and its proposed inline
surface adds a distinct chart, decision, transaction, or explainability pattern beyond the current tools.
Promotion requires an approved UX reference, mutually exclusive routing language, a minimal parameter
schema, and a human-run Yeoman scaffold.

### Policy future

- ▢ `PolicySources` - promote when users need standalone provenance exploration beyond citations in
  `PolicyAnswer`; use source ranking, effective-date filtering, and clause-level evidence.
- ▢ `PrivatePolicySupport` - promote when policy-specific confidential handoff proves distinct from
  `CreateHrCase`; use progressive disclosure and privacy-boundary preview.
- ▢ `PolicyChanges` - promote when policy-change monitoring supports a useful before/after clause diff.

### Time future

- ▢ `TimeOffRequestStatus` - promote when direct request tracking needs a rich approval timeline.
- ▢ `VacationUsage` - promote when historical usage supports a forecast chart and carryover planning.
- ▢ `TeamCoverage` - promote when employee self-service needs a separate coverage heatmap beyond the
  manager-focused `TeamAbsenceCalendar`.

### Money future

- ▢ `ExplainDeductions` - promote when deduction composition and tax-category drill-down merit a
  dedicated visual explainer beyond `ExplainPayChange`.
- ▢ `PayHistory` - promote when multi-period trend analysis adds forecasting or anomaly detection.
- ▢ `PayDocuments` - promote when document comparison, filtering, or secure retrieval becomes more
  than a compact file list.

### Benefits future

- ▢ `CurrentBenefits` - promote when coverage-gap visualization adds value beyond the comparison matrix.
- ▢ `DependentCoverage` - promote when relationship-aware coverage editing supports a safe review flow.
- ▢ `EnrollmentChecklist` - promote when deadline dependencies justify an interactive critical-path view.

### Support future

- ▢ `HrCaseStatus` - promote when case tracking requires a direct prompt surface with a response timeline.
- ▢ `MyHrCases` - promote when cross-case filtering and priority grouping outperform the full-screen board.
- ▢ `QuickHrAnswer` - promote when support knowledge differs materially from cited `PolicyAnswer` behavior.
- ▢ `HrDeskHealth` - promote for service owners when SLA distributions and volume trends have a clear audience.

### Learning future

- ▢ `ContinueLearning` - promote when resumable media or assessment interaction can run meaningfully inline.
- ▢ `LearningProgress` - promote when skill-path trends and target-role gap analysis become available.
- ▢ `LearningRecommendations` - promote when recommendation evidence and comparison avoid a generic catalog.
- ▢ `TeamLearningStatus` - promote when manager compliance cohorts need a privacy-safe heatmap and actions.

### Rewards future

- ▢ `CompensationHistory` - promote when multi-year purchasing-power or progression analysis is available.
- ▢ `ExplainRewardsChange` - promote when annual variance drivers are distinct enough from pay-period change.
- ▢ `EquityVesting` - promote when a vesting timeline can model horizon, value scenarios, and uncertainty.
- ▢ `PensionBenefitsValue` - promote when retirement scenarios support interactive assumptions and projection.

### Team future

- ▢ `ManagerTeamHub` - promote only if a prompt-specific manager summary differs from the Team full-screen landing.
- ▢ `TeamRiskSignals` - promote when transparent, non-diagnostic indicators support explainable manager actions.
- ▢ `StartManagerCheckIn` - promote when agenda composition, history, and scheduling form one reviewable workflow.

### People future

- ▢ `PeopleNetwork` - promote when relationship strength and collaboration paths support an accessible graph.
- ▢ `PrepareForMeeting` - promote when calendar context can produce an evidence-backed preparation board.
- ▢ `OrganizationSignals` - promote when organization changes can be summarized without speculative people analytics.

## Deferred - Dynamic data / API integration

- ▢ Define live service implementations behind the existing interfaces without changing UI view
  models.
- ▢ Add selective PnPjs v4 or Microsoft Graph integrations only when the scenario requires them.
- ▢ Add real policy search, HR connectors, calendar conflicts, people graph, and SharePoint case data.
- ▢ Replace the local action-plan generator with a live service that returns the same
  `IHrActionPlan` shape.
- ▢ Add provisioning, permissions, admin-consent, error, throttling, and fallback documentation.
- ▢ Keep the committed mock mode available as the default reliable showcase.

## Docs and cleanup

- ✅ Update README features and status as each family becomes implemented; never describe planned
  behavior as shipped behavior.
- ✅ Add PnP gallery `assets/sample.json` with 32 implementation screenshots, unique order/alt text,
  local PNG integrity, and raw GitHub URLs validated by `check:gallery`.
- ✅ Add one final implementation screenshot per gallery row and complete the 60-second, 3-minute,
  10-minute business, and 5-minute technical demo scripts.
- ✅ Update solution, declarative-agent, plugin, and Teams manifest naming to Zava Employee Agent.
- ✅ Confirm all component GUIDs, shared bundle entries, localized resources, agent registrations, and tool schemas
  are synchronized.
- ✅ Move stale People Compass boards out of publication assets into documented legacy design sources.
- ✅ Run `heft test --clean --production` with 170 tests and zero failures.
- ✅ Run `heft package-solution --production` and verify one hashed bundle in the ~0.493 MiB package.
- ▢ Commit `sharepoint/solution/zava-employee-agent.sppkg` while keeping other build output ignored.

### Publication readiness gate

- ✅ README includes real screenshots, ready-made package/build paths, local review instructions,
  correct tenant-package video guidance, validation status, safety boundaries, and all demo links.
- ✅ Legacy design boards are separated from the publication asset root.
- ✅ Gallery, generated-plugin, and package-output validators run from `npm run build`.
- ▢ Complete authenticated Copilot prompt routing/property extraction and second-prompt refresh evidence.
- ▢ Complete authenticated host CSP, iframe focus, screen-reader, and Windows high-contrast checks.
- ▢ Run one cold-machine/offline rehearsal of the 60-second, business, and technical demo paths.

## Reusable playbook

- ✅ Recheck the golden [agentic-creation-rules.md](agentic-creation-rules.md) and synchronize this
  sample's reference copy byte-for-byte.
- ✅ Preserve React 17, Fluent UI v9, Heft, token-only styling, mock-first services, relative dates,
  accessibility, reduced motion, and offline runtime behavior throughout implementation.
- ✅ Record progress only in this file; do not create parallel implementation-status documents.

## Open decisions

- ✅ Approve the final Home PNG designs before Family 01 implementation.
- ✅ Keep all ten rail families selectable, using honest placeholders until each family is implemented.
- ✅ Retain all five completed Home components in the 20-tool portfolio rather than removing working
  MCP entry points solely to force an identical per-family quota.
- ✅ Show Team as unavailable with a clear manager-access state for non-managers; do not silently hide
  the family.
- ✅ Use a dedicated annual-value Total Rewards experience that remains visually and conceptually
  distinct from pay-period Payroll.
- ✅ Keep mocked workflow outcomes component-local and reset them on remount; persist only explicit
  session preferences, with no live-system writes.
