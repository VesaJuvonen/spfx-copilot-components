# Zava IT Concierge prompt and routing matrix

Use these copy/paste prompts for routing rehearsal. Each row is generated from the canonical intent catalog and must resolve to exactly one tool. Prompt-derived properties prefill or filter the component; they never execute a consequential action.

## Rehearsal result

- Record tenant prompt-routing results separately from the deterministic local catalog check.
- A passing local check proves catalog, schemas, generated manifests, starters, and this matrix agree; it does not claim authenticated model routing.
